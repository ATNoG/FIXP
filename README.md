# Future Internet Fusion (FIFu)
Proof-of-concept developed under my PhD to enable interoperation between
IP and ICN (NDN and PURSUIT) networks.

FIFu is composed by two main components:
 - **FIXP:** compose the adaptation layer, converting messages from/to
             different network protocols;
 - **FIC (not implemented):** acting as the intelligent layer responsible for configuring,
            managing and supporting the FIXP operation, as well as for storing,
            managing and maintaining the identifiers of resources on each network architectures.

## FIXP 
Modules:
 - **Core:** Main logic of the FIXP, acting as a broker between plugins
 - **Protocol Plugins:** Support for new L3/L4/L5 protocols 
   - _HTTP_
   - _NDN_
   - _PURSUIT_
   - _PURSUIT (multipath)_
 - **Converter Plugins:** Support for content conversion between different networks protocols
   - _HTML_: converts links towards the destination network protocol

## Tools
 - ficatresource (Future Internet Cat Resource): Get a resource matching a
   given URI and write it to stdout.
